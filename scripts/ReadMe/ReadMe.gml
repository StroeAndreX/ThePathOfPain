Essential components:

	DissolveSettings() - Setup script
	DissolveShader() - Draw script
	shDissolve - the shader

To use this shader:

	1. Create a black and white sprite for your dissolve pattern. (Dimensions must match target sprite!)
	2. Call DissolveSettings() at least once, usually in the create event of your object
	3. Call DissolveShader() in the draw event.
	opt. If you need to change mask, colour, etc, just call DissolveSettings() again!

I hope you enjoy this shader!
